# Verified native contracts

These adapters were checked against installed official CLIs and upstream source on 2026-10-27. Native output is untrusted input. JSON files are limited to 20 MiB, malformed or unsupported documents fail parsing, and unknown severity remains unknown. The examples in `test/fixtures/adapters/` are synthetic contract fixtures, not evidence of authenticated scans.

## Installation and native invocation

Installation is always an operator action. Install scanners outside the scanned repository. Pin the versions above when reproducing this verification; future upstream output changes can require parser updates.

```sh
go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/v2/cmd/osv-scanner@v2.7.0
uv tool install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector.git@a5425e594d59a14c3d3eaa39e26847613ba08696
npm install -g @openai/codex-security@0.7.0
npm install -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review@1.13.3
git clone https://github.com/openai/php2shell-checker.git /absolute/tools/php2shell-checker
git -C /absolute/tools/php2shell-checker checkout ffcd3fc82e5b404f2a04a95b2805ca7639d530fa
```

The native invocations appended after configured executable/argv prefixes are:

```sh
osv-scanner scan source -r --no-resolve --no-call-analysis=go --no-call-analysis=rust --format json --output-file /absolute/artifacts/native.json /absolute/repo
skillspector scan /absolute/skill --no-llm --format json --output /absolute/artifacts/native.json
cs scan /absolute/repo --output-dir /private/outside-all-worktrees/results --headless --json
cs export /private/outside-all-worktrees/results --export-format json --output /absolute/artifacts/findings.json
ocr scan --repo /absolute/repo --format json --output /absolute/artifacts/native.json
node /absolute/tools/php2shell-checker/phpcheck.js http://127.0.0.1:8080/ --json
```

`check()` only runs the native `--version` with a 10 second timeout and a 64 KiB output cap through the same bounded process runner as scans. Timeout, cancellation and excess output trigger descendant cleanup. On Windows, the runner invokes the absolute `taskkill.exe` path under the trusted host `SystemRoot` with `/PID … /T /F`, and waits for that helper to finish before returning. On POSIX, it starts the child in a process group, sends SIGTERM to the group, then SIGKILL after 300 ms, and waits for escalation before returning. A final deadline bounds waiting for inherited pipes. `ctx.signal` cancels a probe, and internal `ctx.probeTimeoutMs` allows controlled regression tests to shorten the default; it is not a user configuration option. Checks never probe credentials or send model requests. AI tools additionally require explicit Sec Hub executable configuration; the core enforces `--ai`. PHP requires both explicit executable configuration and a URL. SkillSpector requires a root `SKILL.md`, so it skips a generic repository rather than reporting a successful skill scan. Its MVP adapter always uses static analysis, including with `--ai`.

OSV's default Go call analysis is disabled, as is Rust call analysis; manifest dependency resolution is disabled. Dependency coverage therefore depends on the lockfiles/SBOMs available to OSV. No no-lockfile success option is added. Exit 1 means findings, while other nonzero codes fail execution. Group numeric CVSS ratings map to canonical severity bands; unrecognized ratings remain unknown and native vectors remain in evidence.

SkillSpector supports the current single-skill `issues` JSON shape. On Windows, omit `--output` because SkillSpector 2.12.0 rejects file output there. Sec Hub captures the JSON from stdout and saves the redacted copy in `stdout.txt`. The stdout contract was verified against the native Windows CLI. Windows Store package verification requires a build containing this adapter. Active findings are preserved; suppressed native findings remain in the raw report. Native unsuccessful/incomplete scans raise an error carrying validated findings, so core reports failed coverage while retaining those findings. Exit 1 can mean a risk threshold, findings policy, or incomplete policy; the JSON coverage fields distinguish these.

Codex Security needs its native results outside every enclosing worktree. A small Node wrapper creates a private temporary parent, runs scan then export, and copies the native result tree into `artifacts/codex-security/codex-results` before cleanup. Per-step stdout/stderr are retained and also forwarded to the core's bounded streams. The wrapper forwards termination to the current child; children remain in the core process group. It preserves scan exit 1 after successful export and never exports after a failed scan. The canonical parser accepts the exported `codex-security.findings` v1.0 document, preserving occurrence IDs and code evidence. Findings are labelled reported, which does not assert runtime reproduction.

For a fresh Windows scan with Codex Security 0.7.0, the optional absolute
`scanOptions.pluginPath` maps to the native scan's `--plugin-path`. The
[preparation script](../../scripts/prepare-codex-windows-plugin.py) verifies the
official npm archive and prepares a separate copy that accepts a leading
UTF-8 BOM in the workbench JSON reader. Normal scan completion, sealing, and
export still run upstream. For the offline regression, pass the same npm
archive to `python test/prepare-codex-windows-plugin.test.py <archive>`.

Open Code Review uses full-file `scan`, not a diff-only review. It can create native session metadata. Its general review comments can include non-security categories, which are preserved. Native partial/error statuses, budget exhaustion and review-limit warnings fail coverage while retaining findings. A successful review does not prove every vulnerability was found.

PHP2Shell performs a header/version heuristic and never proves a deployed build contains or lacks a fix. The checker's `unknown` exit 3 becomes a visible unknown finding; `potentially_vulnerable` exit 1 becomes a high-severity candidate; `ok` exit 0 yields no finding. Status/exit inconsistencies and invalid arguments fail. No redirect is followed; the native checker uses GET only as a fallback after HEAD receives 405/501.
